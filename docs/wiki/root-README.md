# Root README

## Overview
Top-level project overview. Currently contains only a short title `seek`, indicating a placeholder or project codename.

## Purpose
- Acts as the first touchpoint when browsing the repository.
- Should be expanded to describe goals, setup, structure, and contribution flow.

## Recommendations
- Add sections: Quick Start, Repo Structure, Tooling, Development, Testing, and CI.
- Link to `docs/` site (this wiki) and any ADRs or architecture notes.
