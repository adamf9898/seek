### Conversation Starter Prompt  
**Theme:** Guidance For Christian Daily Living  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Tone:** Neutral  
**Context:** SEEK (Matthew 6:33), THINK (Philippians 4:8), LOVE (1 Corinthians 13:4-8), PUT (Ephesians 6:11-18)  

**Hook:**  
*A wheel spins unevenly on a cobblestone path—not broken, just needing alignment. Like our daily choices, it skitters until centered on truth.*  

**Core Question:**  
"In Matthew 6:33, we're called to 'seek first the kingdom of God.' Yet Philippians 4:8 urges us to dwell on 'whatever is true, noble, and pure.' How do you practically reconcile *seeking* God’s will with *thinking* on virtuous things when daily distractions pull focus? What’s one tangible step you’ve taken to anchor in Scripture when priorities feel scattered?"  

**Supporting Points:**  
1. **Seek vs. Think:** Does intentional seeking (Matthew 6:33) naturally cultivate Philippians 4:8’s mindset, or are they distinct disciplines?  
2. **Love in Action:** How does 1 Corinthians 13’s definition of love shape your response to conflict when distractions arise?  
3. **Armor Up:** Ephesians 6:11-18 commands us to "put on" spiritual armor. What piece (truth, faith, etc.) feels most crucial for maintaining focus amid chaos?  

**Why It Works:**  
- **Engagement:** Uses a relatable metaphor (wheel) to avoid abstraction.  
- **Depth:** Bridges four scriptures without preaching, inviting personal reflection.  
- **Neutrality:** Avoids leading language; open to diverse experiences.  
- **Action-Oriented:** Asks for concrete examples ("one tangible step").  

**Expected Dialogue Flow:**  
Participants share struggles with distraction → Discuss balancing seeking/thinking → Explore love’s role in perseverance → Highlight armor for resilience → Close with encouragement.
