SEEK — Matthew 6:33 THINK — Philippians 4:8 LOVE — 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 PUT — Ephesians 6:11-18In hope of a good report, hear what the Spirit says to the soul as we are reminded not to rely on our own understanding: Matthew 6:33 says, "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well." How does “seek first” practically impact today’s priorities? What competes for the top spot in your schedule or attention? Philippians 4:8 encourages us, "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things." What is one excellent or praiseworthy focus you can choose today? Jesus gave us a new commandment to love one another as He loves us. What is love exactly? 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 explains, "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails." Which attribute of love challenges you most today? How can you actively protect, trust, hope, and persevere in a relationship? Challenging indeed. God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit provide truth for humanity to walk in faith and make choices guided by His good, pleasing, and perfect will. Ephesians 6:11-18 blesses us with wisdom, teaching us how to act on knowledge as His righteousness reveals obedience. Though all fall short of the glory of God, those who believe in Christ will not perish but have everlasting life in abundance. God created humanity in His image, to live with truth, reason, and purpose. The heart’s desires reveal acceptance or denial of His image, acknowledging truth and allowing decisions to unfold.
