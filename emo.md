In hope of a good report, Hear what THE SPIRIT says to The Soul as we are reminded to look not to our own understanding: Matthew 6:33 says "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well." What does “seek first” practically change about today’s priorities? What competes for first place in your schedule or attention? Listen, Philippians 4:8 says "Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things." What is one “excellent or praiseworthy” focus you can choose today? Jesus gave us a new commandment to love one another as HE loves us. What exactly is love? 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 says "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails." Which attribute of love do you find most challenging today? What is a concrete way to “protect, trust, hope, and persevere” in a relationship? Challenging indeed. GOD, Jesus, & The HOLY SPIRIT provides truth for man to walk in faith with knowledge to make the decision to accept or deny that which is good, pleasing, and perfect WILL OF GOD for you is in your life as Ephesians 6:11-18 truly blesses us with wisdom in what to do with knowledge as HIS righteousness reveals obedience as all fall short of the glory of God, those who believe IN CHRIST shall NOT perish, but HAVE everlasting life forevermore abundantly. GOD created man in HIS own image to be true and have life with reason and purpose as presenting what the heart seeks is revealing the acceptance or the denial of the presence of HIS OWN IMAGE acknowledges truth and allows the decision to choose whatsoever seeks as the heart does manage man with his doings. God is all knowing, The Beginning, and The End, THE ONE TRUE LIVING GOD, The Creator, The Alpha and The Omega, loves, highly favors, blesses a lot and in many ways His creation of man to be perfect as HIS glory, in spirit, truth, and in fear HIS glory rejoices IN THE HOLY SPIRIT, In the body of Christ, HIS power glorifying his kingdom as true. Ephesians 6:11-18 says "Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests." How can you build a habit of “praying on all occasions”?
