Pseudocode plan:
- Keep README brief and clear.
- Preserve existing theme: SEEK | THINK | LOVE | PUT with scripture references (no scripture text).
- Add concise sections: Overview, Quick Start (clone, open, run), Tests, Contributing, License.
- Optimize instructions for Visual Studio users; include optional .NET CLI commands as defaults.
- Avoid assumptions about project specifics; keep wording generic and lightweight.

```Biblical Principles
Guidance for Daily Living

SEEK: Matthew 6:33
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

THINK: Philippians 4:8
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.

LOVE: 1 Corinthians 13:4-8
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.

PUT: Ephesians 6:11-18
Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.
